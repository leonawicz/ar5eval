This application summarizes key results of SNAP's general circulation model (GCM) statistical evaluation and model selection. 
The evaluation is of historical climate model runs over several geographic domains with an Alaska and Arctic focus.
GCM performance is ranked based on minimum error with repsect to a European Re-Analysis (ERA-40) baseline data set using several error metrics. 

This is an application supplement to the publication:

The app enables exploration of model evaluation results pertaining to various spatial domains, climate variables
and error statistics as well as seasonal variability. It also shows suggested differences in model selection for ensemble
membership based on GCM rank variation across these dimensions of the data.

Users can drill down into the climate model evaluation and explore comparative performance of GCMs in numerous and 
detailed ways depending on their areas of interest. The first tab in the app displays general results.
The second shows more detailed information for each geographic domain with a focus on bootstrapped performance rankings
across climate variables. The third tab explores composite model evaluation across geographic domains
with consideration of model selection criteria for ensemble membership.
